## 👋 Hi, it's Utilyre

I like coding and here are some `func` facts about me:

- 📺 [Twitch][twitch] is my stage, and coding is the play.

- 🐦 My [X (former Twitter)][x] is a library of wisdom. Well, mostly the things I
didn't want to forget.

- 🔥 In case of fire, [email me][email].

- 🔑 If it bears my [GPG key][gpg], then lo, it was forged by my own hands.
