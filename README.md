## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, it's Utilyre

I like coding and here are some `func` facts about me:

- [ðŸ’¬ X][x] is where I talk about the cool stuff I've been doing lately.

- Keep up with my devlogs and tutorials on [ðŸŽ¬ YouTube][youtube].

- If it bears my [ðŸ”‘ GPG key][gpg], then lo, it was forged by my own hands.

### [Multiplayer Asteroids](https://github.com/utilyre/go-asteroids)

A classic [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game))-style
multiplayer game implemented using the [Ebiten](https://ebitengine.org)
game engine. The networking layer is built from scratch over
[UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) for real-time online
play.

Check out my YouTube video, ["How I Implemented Multiplayer from Scratch in
Golang"](https://youtu.be/G8nxQ9ESIFA), where I walk through the implementation
details and explain my approach to synchronization using snapshot interpolation.

### Condottiere

In Condottiere, 3-6 players vie to establish their influence and control over
the cities and regions of Italy. Fight with skill and daring and use every tool
at your disposal to reshape the political and military landscape of Italy for
generations to come.

condot is an implementation of
[Condottiere](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/112/condottiere) written in
C++ with [Raylib](https://raylib.com) and [OOP design](./docs/v2.pdf).

Play the live demo at
[utilyre.github.io/condot](https://utilyre.github.io/condot). Make sure to zoom
out your browser if the game appears too large.
